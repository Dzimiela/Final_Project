Several aspects of Appendix A from the APP book provides the basis for this project.  
The principle components of this project are:
1. Problem Identification - What problem will address or what goal are you looking to reach? This requires a written substantiation that describes the nature of the problem and why a developed software system is suited to address this problem. (target length: 1,000 to 1,500 words)
2. Domain Modeling - You have developed a domain model which describes the entities (nouns), associations, transactions (verbs) that captures the business rules that establish the value and integrity of the system.  All of the actions that would cause the state of the system to change would be captured in this diagram.
3. Use Modeling - Given the domain above, you have developed some combination of the following artifacts used to comprehend how actors in the system transact:
  - Use Case Diagram
  - User Story
  - (Optional) Behavioral and Structural UML diagrams
4. Functional Test Plan - Given the domain and use models, you will develop a test plan that specifies a test name and a description of what/why you are testing that reflects the business rules of the system.  This plan would entail the following test types:
  - Unit Tests - Mandatory
  - Integration Tests - Should have
  - End-to-End Tests - Should have
5. Testable Implementation - A Python implementation is necessary such that you are able to demonstrate passing tests from your test plan above.  This implementation should be consistent with the components of the APP Book's architecture shown in Appendix A.

Validation and Justification
There are a number of principles embedded in the APP architecture that you are appropriating for your context.  What is of the greatest interest is your ability to appropriate the guidance of the APP architecture and adapt it to your own problem context and domain.  Further, while you can certain demonstrate in this in your code by way of translating, fitting, and copying from the APP architecture, but it is your ability to speak to this process that cements the exercise and learning.  For this reason, you will be required to also submit an explanation and justification that your appropriation of the APP architecture benefits from the layers in the architecture and the premise behind their components and composition.  Whereas the APP book provides some justification, you will extend this with some light research that further substantiates why the concepts embedded in the architecture are deemed as beneficial.  Use Table 1 from Appendix A as a guide and basis for this.  This too should be about 1,500 words in length.
